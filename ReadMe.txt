This is my first attempt at creating a UI Design. During my internship at Drexel University (August 2018), I took the UI designers work and applyed it to the web as a web developer. To get a better understanding and an all around point of view, I took a crash course on UI Design. It was fun using Adobe XD for the first time and creating some mock-ups. I have provided my heroku link for viewing.
